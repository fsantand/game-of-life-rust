# Conway Game of Life

An implementation of the game of life by John Conway in Rust using Piston as a gui

## Running

To run, simply run `cargo run`, it will fetch the dependencies and start the game 

## Controls

* `R` - Run simulation
* `N` - Step over one generation
* `Left Click` - Toggle cell
* `Right Click` - Count adjacent neighbors

## Motivation

I've really trying to learn Rust, but never got the time to do it, and I had a pending quarrel
with the Game of Life (an old assignment from when I started studying CS). It was fun, there're
bugs, but it is what it is.
